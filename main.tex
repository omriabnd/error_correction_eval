In recent years there is a growing interest in grammatical error correction (GEC). The four competitions devoted to the subject that took place in the last years: HOO-2011,2012(\cite{dale2011helping,dale2012hoo}), CoNLL-2013,2014(\cite{kao2013conll,ng2014conll}) and the rising amount of academic interest gave rise to an increasing interest in evaluation methods of both grammatical error detection and correction(\cite{tetreault2008native,madnani2011they,chodorow2012problems}), including a dedicated scorer(\cite{dahlmeier2012better}). Evaluation is especially difficult due to the fact that an ungrammatical sentence may have various corrections, each equally good.

In this task faithfulness to the meaning of the source is crucial, this idea was embraced by preceding work ( \cite{brockett2006correcting}) and by the used evaluation $F_{0.5}$ score (\cite{ng2014conll}). The pursue of being conservative in that manner might bring a daunting outcome, being too formally conservative. In simpler words, not correcting errors.

We evaluated outputs of state-of-the-art and about 15 other different GEC correction systems, from now correctors. We considered number of words changed, indexes changed and reconstruction of sentence boundaries. We found the correctors to be over formally conservative in all aspects(\ref{sec:formal_conservatism}).

We pursue two approaches to overcome this problem, increasing the amount of references(\ref{sec:increase-reference}) (hereby $M$) and assessing semantic conservatism(\ref{sec:Semantics}) rather than formal one. 
Increasing the amount of references was proposed before and pursued with $M=2$, but no assessment of its sufficiency or its added value over $M=1$ has been made. In order to address this gap we first characterize the distribution of possible corrections for a sentence. We leverage this characterization to characterize the distribution of the scores as a function of $M$, and consequently assess the biases introduced by taking $M=1,2$ as with previous approaches. 
We find that assessment based on these values of $M$ dramatically under-estimate the corrector scores. 
We back our analysis of these biases with an analysis of the variance of these estimators.
Throughout this statistical investigation we check both the $F$ score often used for evaluation, and the accuracy score commonly used for training.

For assessing semantic conservatism we discuss two questions. Can it induce a well-defined structure on learner language? Are corrections in fact semantically conservative? For the latter, we need to verify that the corrections make few (if any) semantic changes. our results indicate that this is the case: the corrections are similar in structure to the source. Motivated by the recent MT semantic evaluation HUME(\cite{birch2016hume}) we use UCCA(\cite{abend2013universal}) for semantic representation as a test case.


\subsection{Assessing formal conservatism\label{sec:formal_conservatism}}

The field of GEC was always thriving for conservatism in its corrections, with the prominent example of using $F_{0.5}$ emphasizing precision over recall(\cite{ng2014conll}). we wish to highlight the problem that arises from pursuing this conservatism as done today.

Then, we wished to be conservative, and we achieved that, why shouldn't we rejoice just yet? Theoretically, we might be progressing towards not correcting at all, instead of progressing towards correcting more accurately. 

Our goal was to analyze the output of the participants in Conll
2014 shared task\cite{ng2014conll} and of the current state of the
art \cite{rozovskaya2014building}. 
Manual analysis showed excessive formal conservatism and under correction. Albeit important, manual analysis is not enough and we aimed for generating some quantitative measures. 
For that we first aligned each learner language text unit
to a corresponding corrected text unit. We used an exact match for last words in a sentence as a boundary symbol, thus allowing a text unit to be more than one sentence when a sentence was split or concatenated. 
This alignment is needed because we only know the final corrections, a main obstacle that was considered
in the assessment methods as well\cite{dahlmeier2012better}.
Our first result to present in \ref{fig:split} will be how many sentences are concatenated and
how many split using the different methods. Moreover, we present the same measures for the corrections done in  NUS\cite{dahlmeier2013building} gold standard. NUS is a parallel
corpus of learner language paragraphs and corrected versions which is the de
facto standard since CoNLL 2013\textbackslash{}14 shared tasks \cite{kao2013conll,ng2014conll}.
The NUS corpus consists of paragraphs about
various topics containing about 400 words each.
To have better evaluation of the real goal of corrections we also
compute all of the measures on the TreeBank of Learner Language \cite{berzak2016universal}based
on the Cambridge First Certificate in English (FCE) \cite{yannakoudakis2011new},
a new large parallel corpus containing only ungrammatical sentences of learners native of different languages.

Next we were interested in how many words are being changed and how much word order was disrupted. 

In order to align tokens we use the fact that, unlike in translation,
aligning words is a simple task as most of the words are kept unchanged,
deleted fully, added, or only changed slightly. This allows us to
align words well using edit distance measure, knowing that words that
exists in both text units will have low edit distance. We consider
aligning to sets of words a bipartite graph matching problem, with
weights according to the edit distance. For tie breaking, we add a
penalty. The penalty is always smaller than 1, the minimum cost of
one action, favoring a sentence order when a word occurs twice.
 
With the aligning we calculated the number of words changed per sentence to assess how many words were edited or removed. 
To measure how much the word order was preserved
calculates Spearman's rho for the indexes of the aligned words in each text unit.

\end{figure}

Lets discuss the results in \ref{fig:words_changed}\ref{fig:rho} and \ref{fig:split} starting at what we see isn't changed in the gold standard. We can think of it as what calls for formal conservatism. We see that it is most common for a sentence to have
no change, not to concatenate two consecutive sentences and not to
split a sentence into two. We also observe high correlation coefficient
for most of the sentences. Summing it all together we indeed have
more unchanged than changed in every measure we have. But, with a
closer look we should also notice that it mostly tells us about the
dataset. Specifically the level of English found in the dataset.
These measures should be seen as a gold standard of the amount of
corrections to be done, and as we might wish to be a bit conservative
and not exceed it, this is still where we should aim.

When we broaden our view and consider the results of the different
correctors, the picture is clear. All correctors are over conservative.
It is not only that correctors don't tend to overcorrect, they all,
to the last one, by all the measures we checked, undercorrect a lot
and are over conservative. {*}is this remark interesting at all, we show the graph for 2 corrections per sentence anyway{*}A special case would be the Cambridge output that has more sentences that have corrections than the gold standard, but unlike the gold standard almost all these sentences have 1 correction, when removing one word changes, or counting the number of changes the differences are still great . {*}do the plots need textual analyzing? e.g. explain why do we see under correction in fig 1 2 3?{*}


\section{May lack of corrections lead to over formal conservatism?\label{sec:increase-reference}}

As noted before, assessment might push towards being too conservative. The cause for that
might hide in the number of references, denoted $M$. Before we show it, lets assume
that each ungrammatical sentence has some possible corrections. From
the corrections only 2 are in the gold standard. This leads to low coverage, a high probability that a valid correction is not in the gold standard. In turn, that would lead to
problems in both assessment and development process. 

In the assessment,
results will not be reliable, having correct sentences regarded as mistakes. This leads to more fluctuations and low scores even for a perfect output.

Perhaps less obvious will be how low coverage affects the development
process. Even if corrected well, sentences which have more possible
corrections will grant lower scores on precision for correcting, while recall will not grant high reward for correcting, as most of the time the correction will be considered false anyway. This, and especially in the precision oriented scenario, will lead implicitly in algorithm development cycles, to learn \textbf{not} to correct those sentences at all. Also, consider any machine learning algorithm which somehow represents the notion that not correcting is more important than false correction. An example for such algorithm would be one that uses a loss function with a special case for the output equals the input. Such algorithms would also learn to avoid correcting, as corrections would most likely results in high loss, even when their correction is actually valid.
In the rest of this section we will show that the assumptions we made are the current reality. 

\subsection{A distribution of corrections}

Lets denote $X=x_{1}\ldots x_n\sim L$ as the considered
sentences for evaluation where $L$ is a distribution over all learner sentences from the domain. 
For each $D_{x_i}$ the distribution of corrections over a sentence $x_i$ there exists the set of gold standard annotations $\left\{ y_{1}^{i},\ldots,y_{M}^{i}\right\} \sim D_{x_i}$. Currently, in all the common corpora $M$ is constant, we will treat it as such, but generalizing from $M$ in general to specific $m_i$ is trivial. The corrector's output is a function $f\left(x_{i}\right)$. An assessment statistic, a score, is a function $\hat{S}=Eval\left(f\left(x_{1}\right),\left\{ y_{1}^{1},\ldots,y_{M}^{1}\right\} \ldots,f\left(x_{N}\right),\left\{ y_{1}^{N},\ldots,y_{M}^{N}\right\} \right)$.

We found no work that describes or assesses the way $D_x$ distributions are, and we aim to do so for the purpose of assessing, but also as a very important contribution by itself. 

\subsection{Data}
To be able to answer interesting statistical questions about assessment we first need to understand the behaviour of the distributions $D_x$. For that we randomly picked 52 sentences with max length 15 from the Nus \cite{dahlmeier2013building} test data. The length condition was made to make crowdsourcing annotation more reliable. It also made sure we will not capture many interleaving errors from text units that could have been separated. Also, as manual analyzing suggested, very short sentences were regarded as sentence tokenization errors and discarded. Histogram of sentence lengths showed a lot of the mass is below this threshold.

Albeit too expensive for assessment of each development cycle, human assessment by crowdsourcing is a very useful tool. Crowdsourcing assessment was shown to be helpful in different tasks such as translation{*}cites -translation{*} and even more so in GEC \cite{madnani2011they} as GEC is a more intuitive task than translation. Thus, for each of the sentences gathered we asked Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to correct them, leading to 2600 corrections overall, 50 for every sentence. A couple of sentences did not need correction according to a large part of the workers and hence were discarded.

For each sentence we used UnseenEst \cite{zou2015quantifying}, a statistical algorithm that quantify the distribution of frequencies. Manual tests with different inputs were done with satisfying result. Surprisingly, the distributions have a large number of corrections with low probability and a rather small number of frequent corrections. For that reason, it might be reasonable to look at the distribution as taken from a heavy tailed distribution such as a power law distribution. The distributions gathered, together with the rest of the gathered data are given as a \href{https://github.com/borgr/assess_learner_language}{contribution}.

\subsection{Assessment values\label{sec:Assessment-values}}

The values an assessment process produces are the base foundation of
 every improvement in Computer Sciences. This gives the value an
  almost sacred place. We think this role should be earned and measured.
 
 \paragraph{Accuracy}We shall begin by analyzing accuracy. While this score is not published it is the usual choice for training machine learning algorithms. We suggest its more common use for another important reason which is interpretability.
For simplicity we assume a corrector has a constant probability $c$ to correct an ungrammatical sentence. The probability to get a specific accuracy assessment over $N$ sentences will be distributed as $$\hat{S}\sim\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}Ber\left(c\cdot p_i\right)}{N} $$ 
where $p_i=p_{covered}\left(x_i\right) $ is the probability that the i'th sentence correction will be in the gold standard. 
$Ber\left(p\right)$ is a Bernoulli variable with probability $p$. This is a Poisson Binomial random variable divided by $N$. 

First, we are to look at some general properties.
 One interesting property is that the number of sentences considered does not change the expected accuracy value.
 Another property to consider is that the ratio between scores of different correctors stays the same no matter what are $p_1,\ldots,p_n$. So in this assessment we get a reliable way of comparing two correctors, but we underestimate performance depending on our coverage. The only way to get more coverage will be to acquire more annotations.
 
 In the

 	\label{fig:accuracy_vals}
 \end{figure}
  \begin{figure}
  	%	\includesvg{exact__repeat_1000_accuracy.svg}
  	\caption{Mean accuracy values for perfect correctors with different gold standard size.}
  	\label{fig:accuracy_vals_ind}
  \end{figure}
 
 Based on the corrections we gathered and the distribution estimation we numerically compute the average coverage of a given sentence given that we randomly sample $M$ corrections for our gold standard. For every $M$ we take the mean coverage of sentence $x_i$ to be $p_i$. This defines the Poisson binomial distributions. We also relax the results when using accuracy for indexes changes in sentence, considering only which words were deleted, changed, and how many words were added. In \ref{fig:accuracy_vals} and \ref{fig:accuracy_vals_ind} we show the expected accuracy of a randomly selected perfect corrector for different values of $M$. The data suggests there is still a lot to be gained by choosing bigger $M$ values, even in the relaxed case.
 
  As mentioned earlier, this measure is the $100\%$ and the ratio for different $c$ values is the accuracy ratio between corresponding correctors. This measures need not change when we enlarge the test data, the variance of the assessment is all that changes. So both when we consider the amount of annotations needed and a corrector performance, it would be advisable to take these numbers into account.

\paragraph{$F$} While accuracy is very popular for machine learning tasks, $F$ score is currently the only measure to be published in articles. As $F$ score is much more complicated, no analytical way to predict its value was proposed \cite{yeh2000more}. 

We assess different expected results for perfect outputs with different $M$ values (see \ref{tab:F_Ms}). It is a challenge to do that without generating a whole dataset with enough annotations plus a large test set to account for the variability of different annotators. We sample for each ungrammatical sentence in the gold standard a sentence from our data set and $M$ corrections uniformly sampled from the empirical distribution we have collected. We also sample a perfect output in the same way (with $M=1$). With that we use the many corrections for each sentence to account for annotation variability and hold the ratios of different corrections stable. At last, we transform each of the corrections into a set of edits as requested by the $M^2$ scorer\cite{dahlmeier2012better}.  

This would be a good place to mention the drawbacks and assumptions of the methods we are using. We assume that the sentences we picked are a good representation of the overall sentences, but know they might be a bit simpler as we did not choose very large sentence for the reasons mentioned earlier. Another assumption is that the simple automatic edits are not making a big change in respect to the human edits.

In respect to the edits, we note that the score for $M=2$ is a bit lower than one would expect. This may result by the mechanical creation of edits. The different edits might give bias to the results. Edit borders are not part of what correctors need to extract, in other words, they are information that is not inherent in the task. Those edits are another problem in the scoring system itself. It makes crowdsourcing much harder, and the edits are yet another thing that annotations often disagree upon(\cite{dahlmeier2012better}). It might be another reason that calls for use of another, more interpretable score.

To conclude, on both measures we see a large improvement in coverage when enlarging $M$ suggesting that a more reasonable $M$ to choose would be somewhere around 8 where the high probability corrections are probably covered and the graph turns semi-linear. The results also strongly support the hypothesis assessment values are very low, and hence might be a cause for over conservatism.
 Another conclusion to be made is that given a value from the assessment process we may estimate how low the value is in respect to the perfect assessment. Some may wish to correct for this under assessment.

\subsection{On significance and variation}

So far we have discussed the mean values of the assessment and showed they are lower bounds of the real values of the same assessment with a full gold standard. For some uses the value itself does not matter, what really matters is whether one value is significantly higher than another value. The assumption about significance was that with enough sentences this problem can be overcome.

We wish to show a somewhat more complex point of view, stating that the way to reduce variation in assessment values would be to balance between the number of sentences and the number of annotations per sentence. We also provide the numbers needed for choosing how to balance wisely. 

Choosing how to balance is dependent on the goals of the one collecting data, and affects the mean value as well, as discussed in \ref{sec:Assessment-values}. Thus, we will not discuss this issue here and just point out that such questions have been studied in various fields such as genetics\cite{ionita2010optimal}.

So, why is significance more complicated? Basically, because variance is more complex than mean. While $\mathbb{E}_{y\sim d_x, x\sim L}\left(\hat{S}\right)$ vary only as we change $M$
the number of annotations, but not $N$ the number of corrections,
$Var_{y\sim d_x, x\sim L}(\hat{S})$ depends on both. We try to assess and give an upper
bound on how much it varies for different $M$ and $N$, allowing
for both a smart allocation of resources when building a corpus and for assessing on given corpora whether two correctors are actually different.

\begin{figure}
	%	\includesvg{exact__repeat_1000_accuracy.svg}
	\caption{F Score results with different sizes of gold standard.}
	\label{tab:F_Ms}
\end{figure}

	%	\includesvg{exact__repeat_1000_accuracy.svg}
	\caption{F Score results for different correctors including confidence interval.}
	\label{fig:F_correctors}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Accuracy}As before, we start considering the analytic formalism we have for accuracy. For that, sentences which were not corrected, or wrongly corrected have no variance with different $m$s, corrected sentences do. The variation of the Poisson binomial random variable we have is $\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_i\cdot\left(1-p_i\right)$ and as we divide the variable by $n$ we get $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_i\cdot\left(1-p_i\right)}{n^2}$. 
The variation is proportional to the square of the number of sentences chosen given fixed $p_i$ values. Given a fixed $N$ variation gets lower as $p_i$s get away from $0.5$, a change that, from a certain point, occurs when $M$ is increased.

\paragraph{$F$}We use bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap \cite{efron1987better}, to assess the $95\%$ confidence interval of different correctors with the current NUS test data ($m=2$), based on the same process as in \ref{sec:Assessment-values}. Results can be seen in \ref{fig:F_correctors}.

{*} this is redundant, all said in values, need to combine and use the better one{*}
To account for different $M$ values we randomly choose a sentence for each sentence in the NUS test data that needed correction by the current gold standard. For each sentence we sample $M$ corrections as a gold standard and one correction to be the perfect corrector output. Then we transform each correction to a set of edits as this is a requirement of the $M^2$ scorer(\cite{dahlmeier2012better}). The results suggesting no great improvement of significance should be expected in the transition from $M=2$ to $M=5,8$ can be seen in \ref{tab:F_Ms} 

\subsection{discussion}

If the NLP community has agreed one correction is not enough\cite{tetreault2008native}
we can now say 2 is no magic number either. The gain from each annotation in respect to mean value is still high and only at about 8 becomes semi-linear. We can also see the effect of different references amounts on significance and mean value of both accuracy and precision, recall and F score.
We see that considering the changed indexes, looking for example at different synonyms as the same correction, still holds a very large number of different corrections for every sentence.

\section{Second approach: Semantic Similarity\label{sec:Semantics}}

In the history of GEC, conservatism was considered an
important trait of a corrector\cite{brockett2006correcting}.
This was also the reason why $F_{0.5}$ became since conll2014\cite{ng2014conll}
the measure of choice for GEC evaluation, emphasizing
precision over recall. This emphasis can be understood as encouraging
avoidance of wrong corrections at the cost of correcting less errors
overall. The thought that stands behind such emphasis is that a user
would be understanding towards errors he did, of which he is probably
not even aware, not being corrected, but would not be so understanding
when he sees a correction changes what he knows to be correct. We want to refine
this idea and suggest that there are subtleties we better address
in this intuition.

In the task of GEC it is important to be
conservative, not to overcorrect. The user expects the minimum corrections
necessary and wants no intervention in what he wishes to say. More
specifically, he expects that what he has said would not be changed
into something he did not. In this we may find two notions of conservatism,
formal conservatism and semantic conservatism. Where any change in
the original string would not be considered formal conservative, only
changes in meaning are accounted for invalidating semantic conservatism. 

In many of the uses for correction,
the user does understand his grammar is not perfect and would accept
a change in grammar when needed. Because of this approval we also
hypothesis, and it may call for a user study to prove or disprove
this hypothesis, that users might accept a correct text unit of theirs
being corrected to another correct text unit with the same meaning.
This would be an example of being semantically conservative but not formally so.
Maybe even more importantly, we aim to have as many correct sentences
as possible, but as the grammar isn't fully correct in the first place,
nor is the user's understanding of it, failing to correct grammar
is acceptable. Changing meaning will be totally unacceptable, and
also surely detectable by the user. In other words, the users do expect
the corrector to be active and not too formally conservative, but
only as long as it is semantically conservative. 

Moreover, as corrections are based on statistics, they might even
just correct to a more common way of saying the same thing. Such unnecessary
correction is not formally conservative, and at GEC maybe be unwanted, but not strictly unwanted as overall
it is semantically conservative still. Additionally, some may even
say this correction is a needed one because it has a better grammar considering
Fuzzy Grammar\cite{lakoff1973fuzzy,madnani2011they} or a more fluent
way to say the exact same thing. The latter was suggested as a necessary
shift in the goals of GEC\cite{sakaguchi2016reassessing}.
Considering all this, we propose that next generation correctors and evaluation will be focused on semantic conservatism
when possible rather than on formal conservatism.

\subsection{Uses of semantic annotation}

As semantic annotation was not used before to aid GEC, it is worth mentioning the a-priori reasons for developing
it. The first and perhaps the most obvious use of semantic annotation
would be to use it as a feature for correctors. The annotation may
capture the gist that is supposed to stay the same when correcting,
allowing the corrector to filter results or re-rank them based on
the annotation or just to put it inside the mesh of features and learn
automatically what to do with it, just as done with grammatical annotation.
Later in this section we will not only discuss how to compare those
features, specifically UCCA, but also why it is suspected to be a
valuable feature.

Another approach of using semantic annotation would be for assessment.
Reliable assessment by a gold standard might be hard to obtain (see
\ref{sec:increase-reference}), and human annotation for each output is great\cite{madnani2011they}
but costly, especially considering development process. In these conditions,
given a reliable semantic annotation we can enhance the reliability
of our assessment. One way to do that might be to decouple the meaning
from the structure. We propose a broad idea for a reduction from grammatical
error detection and a comparable semantics annotation to grammatical
error correction assessment. Lets assume we have both a reliable error
detection tool and a good way to measure semantic changes. Then, we
can transform assessment to a 3 steps assessment. First, detect errors
in the original text. Assess the percentage of needed corrections
that were actually corrected. Second, assess how much of was the semantics
changed. Give a negative score for changing semantics. Third, use
the error detection again to assess how many errors exist in the correction
output, whether uncorrected by the corrector or new errors presented
by the correction process itself. \\

This assessment was partially inspired by the WAS evaluation scheme\cite{chodorow2012problems},
in short it states we should account in the assessment for 5 types,
not only the True\textbackslash{}False Positive\textbackslash{}Negative
but also for the case where the annotation calls for a correction,
and the corrector did a correction, but one that is unlike the annotation's
one. With the proposed assessment we can measure how many of the corrections
were corrected correctly (First + Second), and how many errors do
we have eventually (Third) and combine them to get something similar
to the Precision Recall that is widely used. We can also account for
the places where the error was detected and check if it was corrected
in a way that makes it grammatical and did not change semantics, the
fifth type. We do that without getting a human to confirm this is
indeed a correction.

This system would be even more informative than the current one. Allowing assessment of
what exactly is the part in which a corrector failed. Answering questions
like: was it over formally conservative and did not make enough corrections?
Was it making changes in the right places but not correcting grammar
successfully? Was the corrector correcting grammar but changing things
it was not supposed to? etc.

\subsection{grammar can be annotated but is ill defined}

Syntactic representation is very popular and useful in many NLP tasks{*}{*}cites{*}{*}.
Thus, one thought that rises to mind is to use grammar annotation
to evaluate corrections. While not useless, this approach is not well
defined, and unclear bot practically and theoretically. One might
say that the grammar would be the one induced by the actual words
that appear in the sentence. This would lead to annotation that calls
for applying the syntax of Proper English to the different learner
languages that just don't correspond to it. Thus, the structures may
differ between different learners and they will tell us little about
how to understand the sentence. This approach was being pursued in
\cite{berzak2016universal}. 

Others may suggest, and indeed they have\cite{nagataphrase}, an opposite
approach, saying the grammar meant by the learner is the one we should
tag, but that requires having a corrected form of the sentences. Later\ref{sec:increase-reference}
we show that for many sentences different corrections are possible.
And where as sentences differ so does their grammar. later in this
section, we propose semantic annotation as a well defined structure.

\subsection{UCCA}
A UCCA annotation for a sentence $s$ is a labeled DAG $G$, whose
leaves are the words of $s$. For every node in $G$,
we define its yield to be its leaf descendants. The
semantic units for $s$ according to $G$ are the yields
of nodes in $G$.

\subsection{Learner language can be annotated by UCCA}

At least theoretically, semantics are well defined even on ungrammatical
text. With the right tools we might capture at least some of the semantics
of sentences and use them for whatever we wanted grammar for and for
other tasks. In this work we will use Universal Conceptual Cognitive
Annotation (UCCA)\cite{abend2013universal}, we will show that practically
there are semantic annotation schemes that can be used for the purposes
discussed.

But as in the syntactic representation, before we can claim anything
about semantics using UCCA it is needed to show that UCCA is even
consistent when applied to ungrammatical language such as learner
language. To do that we used NUS\cite{dahlmeier2013building}. We employed two cognition graduate students, both
with background of working for a couple of years as translators. Each
one had received the guidelines to read and annotated a couple of
proper English paragraphs and then learner language paragraphs as
an exercise. These paragraphs were compared between the annotators
and each disagreement discussed in the hope of finding common annotation
mistakes and choosing a methodological approach to borderline cases.
After that each annotator has annotated 2 learner language paragraphs
consisting of almost 800 UCCA nodes each. Over the uncoordinated paragraphs
we computed the strict inter annotator agreement mentioned by \cite{abend2013universal}
considering each Node in the directed acyclic graph (DAG) of UCCA
annotation as agrees if and only if its label and the labels of all
its span leaves were considered to have the same labels respectively,
from that we derive an F1 score. 

We got an F1 score for the inter annotator agreement of 0.845 with
Precision 0.834 and Recall 0.857 we see that as enough to be a proof
that UCCA can be applied to, especially considering those numbers
are a bit higher than the inter annotator agreement reported in the
reported originally for formal English\cite{abend2013universal}.
We explain the rise in agreement by the fact that the guidelines and
procedures were refined since UCCA was first introduced and not to
superiority of UCCA for annotating learner language. A similar F1
score for inter annotator agreement (0.849) over 2 corrected paragraphs
suggests the same.

\subsection{Semantics are preserved when correcting grammar}


As a next step we needed to check our hypothesis that indeed when correcting we expect semantic conservatism. With UCCA as our case study we asked each annotator to annotate corrected paragraphs corresponding
to ones he already annotated, 7 different paragraphs were annotated
in this way. To avoid misleading high score due to the fact that each
annotator annotated both the learner language paragraph and the corrected
paragraph 3 different tuples of paragraphs were annotated by both
annotators allowing a cross comparison. It means that for each paragraph
we compared the annotation of the learner language done by one annotator
with the annotation of the other annotator done for the corrected
paragraph and vice versa. 

As a next step a comparison between the annotations was needed, but
there exists no measure for how similar two different UCCA annotations
of different texts are. We considered using suggested semantic measures
such as SMATCH\cite{cai2013smatch}but it can not work for UCCA or
DAG similarity measures such as graph kernels (e.g.\cite{kashima2003marginalized}),
but those tend to work on bigger graphs and would be the wrong tool
for the small UCCA DAGs. Thus, a new measure is called upon.

\subsection{Similarity measures\label{subsec:Similarity-measures}}

We propose several new methods to compare UCCA annotation of a learner\\
language with UCCA annotation of corrected texts, giving a more accurate
measure than the upper bound suggested by \cite{sulem2015conceptual}for
comparing two parallel texts in different languages, while keeping
the essence of comparing how many of the aligned nodes conserve meaning
and tag. For that we may think for a moment on GEC as
translation from learner language to Proper English, and a good translation
would be a translation which keeps the meaning but has the syntax
of English. Considering that, just like in translation we can align
words from the learner language to the corresponding words in English
and keep record of how many of those nodes kept their labels.

As comparing labels is trivial, and done before us. We should focus on how we propose to
align nodes. First, note that alignment should not be at
the token level, as we want to allow tokens to be corrected - replaced or removed -
as long as the higher structures convey the same meaning. We thus
prune the labels above the leaves, the tokens of the sentence. To
define an alignment of the nodes, we suggest some possible ways, all
based on first aligning the words in order to give order to the DAG
and then comparing the structure in one way or another.

We align words in the same manner explained in \ref{sec:formal_conservatism}. As to aligning nodes, we can use word spans of each node, based on
the token alignment and the DAG structure, to choose how best to align.
A first and most straightforward approach would be to compare all
pairs of nodes in parallel paragraphs and to each node from one paragraph
assign the one most similar node, span wise from the other. That approach
is quite similar to the inter annotator agreement aligning, but it
has three drawbacks; it is assymetric; it may be over optimistic aligning
nodes without considering the DAG structure; and second it might be
slow for many nodes. Being assymetric is not much of a problem as
we can compute the measure twice and use the mean of the results,
that would also be the case for other assymetric methods we suggest.
In order to address the other drawbacks we propose different aligning
methods.

A second method driven by the assumption that nodes higher in the
hierarchy are more important to the semantic representation is measuring
the largest cut in which nodes are aligned (top down) to each other
and have the same labels. This is a harsher lower similarity
score but one of which might be more representative of the semantics
that are kept and hopefully more informative for tasks that will use
it.

A third type of methods were token similarity methods, these methods
use one kind of aligning (top down, bottom up or all to all) and only
compare the meaningful nodes. This was called upon by \cite{sulem2015conceptual}. 
This approach makes sense due to the fact that some labels
are well defined and thought upon while others are still vague and
call for future work on refining or adjusting them, moreover, some
labels are more semantic while other labels are currently just a place
holder as each node must get a level, and the semantic role is not
always clearly defined (e.g. the word ``is'' in ``he is walking''
seem to be more syntactically related than semantically). The unused
labels are center, elaborator, function, relation, linker, ground
and connector.

A bit different way than all the others is to compute the labeled
tree edit distance\cite{zhang1989simple}, for that we first needed
the trees to be ordered, we did that in a top down fashion. An interesting
future work would be to use unordered tree edit distance methods\cite{zhang1992editing}.

All of the code to implement UCCA structures, align them and evaluate
them is also given as a \href{https://github.com/borgr/assess_learner_language}{contribution}.
So is code used to create the rest of the paper.

	\subsection{Results}
	
	We present in \ref{tab:Distances} the scores of the different presented
	methods. For each method we present the average results of 9 tuples
	of paragraphs annotated by the same annotator and 6 tuples where each
	paragraph was annotated by a different annotator.
	
	Finally, we present as a control measure and a bound on the best score
	we can expect to get in such comparison the scores of 7 paragraphs
	in which we compare two annotations for the same paragraph using all
	the similarity measures discussed, it can be thought of as a different
	way to defining inter annotator agreement. Note that a similarity
	of 1 and distance of 0 is indeed reached when comparing an annotation with itself.
	
	In \ref{tab:Token_analysis} we present the results of the token analysis, the
	upper bound suggested by \cite{sulem2015conceptual}, showing similar
	results for learner language - corrected tuples as those seen in English
	- French comparison.

	\subsection{Discussion}
	
	From the result we learn a number of things, we show that the upper
	bounds in table \ref{tab:Token_analysis} suggest high stability of UCCA over GEC, and the results are similar to those shown over
	translation. This upper bound seem not to be very strict if the other
	measures are to be considered true values. 
	However, due to aligning errors those measures are actually a close lower bound more than they are an exact value.
	
	We see that measurements for symmetry that are similar to the inter
	annotator agreement measure also suggest high stability, achieving
	scores not much lower than the one different annotators get for the
	same paragraph. This result is quite strong as an inter annotator
	agreement is the upper bound being the score of comparing a paragraph to itself. 
	Most importantly we learn from it all that even when correcting grammatical errors, the semantic structure (as represented by UCCA at least) is hardly changed and thus can be used as a tool to avoid introducing semantic changes when trying to only change grammar. 
	The symmetry measures we introduce can be used to enforce semantic conservatism.
	In conclusion, we have shown some direct ways to measure
	semantic conservatism. Such ways will allow correctors to be less formally conservative while controlling semantic conservatism. Thus, focusing on the conservatism type users - and hence we - are more interested in.
